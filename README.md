# ðŸŒ€ Gravitational Wave Signal Classification 

## Overview
Gravitational wave detection has revolutionized astrophysics by unveiling cosmic phenomena such as black hole mergers and neutron star collisions. This project focuses on classifying gravitational wave signals using advanced machine learning techniques, leveraging the **[Gravity Spy Gravitational Waves dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tentotheminus9/gravity-spy-gravitational-waves/data)** from Kaggle. The dataset comprises **31,868 images** across **22 classes**, capturing both authentic gravitational wave signals and various noise artifacts.


## Project Objectives
This project aims to:
1. **Preprocess data** to ensure balanced representation of each signal class.
2. **Extract features** to highlight significant waveform patterns.
3. **Train a deep learning model** to classify gravitational wave signals.
4. **Evaluate the model's performance** using metrics such as:
   - Accuracy
   - Precision
   - Recall
   - F1-score

The ultimate goal is to develop a robust model capable of reliably distinguishing genuine gravitational wave signals from noise.

## Dataset
The **Gravity Spy Gravitational Waves dataset**, sourced from Kaggle, is central to this project. It contains:
- **31,868 labeled images**.
- **22 classes**, representing authentic signals and noise artifacts.
