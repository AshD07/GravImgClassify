Overview of the project-

 Gravitational wave detection has transformed astrophysics by enabling the observation of
 cosmic events such as black hole mergers and neutron star collisions. This project centers on
 classifying gravitational wave signals using advanced machine learning techniques, drawing
 upon the Gravity Spy Gravitational Waves dataset from Kaggle, which consists of 31,868
 images spanning 22 classes of authentic gravitational wave signals and various noise
 artifacts.
 Albert Einstein first predicted gravitational waves in 1916 through his General Theory of
 Relativity. These waves carry crucial information about their sources, o ering insights into
 gravity and otherwise invisible cosmic phenomena. Indirect evidence for gravitational
 waves emerged in 1974 when astronomers Russell Hulse and Joseph Taylor discovered a
 binary pulsar system, further confirming the existence of gravitational waves and earning
 them the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1993.
 A significant milestone in gravitational wave astronomy occurred on September 14, 2015,
 when LIGO achieved its first direct detection of waves generated by the collision of two
 black holes located approximately 1.3 billion light-years away. LIGO employs an advanced
 Michelson interferometer setup with two arms, each 4 kilometers long, to detect minute
 distortions in spacetime. Its innovative design features Fabry-Perot cavities that allow the
 laser to reflect multiple times, e ectively extending the length of the arms to 1,200
 kilometers and enhancing sensitivity to faint signals.
 Building on this foundational knowledge, this project aims to develop a model for classifying
 gravitational wave signals. It begins with data preprocessing to ensure a balanced
 representation of each signal class, followed by feature extraction to highlight key waveform
 patterns. A deep learning model is then trained on this data to di erentiate gravitational
 waves from noise. Finally, we evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy,
 precision, recall, and F1-score, ensuring its reliability in identifying genuine signals.
